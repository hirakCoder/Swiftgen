# Testing the Critical Fixes

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd /Users/hirakbanerjee/Desktop/SwiftGen/swiftgen-mvp/backend
python main.py
```

### 2. Open the UI
Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000

### 3. Test Modification UI Fix

#### Step 1: Create a Simple App
Type in chat: "create a simple calculator app"

#### Step 2: Wait for Generation
Let it complete and launch in simulator

#### Step 3: Test Modification (THIS IS THE KEY TEST)
Type: "add dark mode toggle to settings"

#### What to Look For:
‚úÖ Immediate chat response: "Perfect! I'll add that feature to Calculator right away..."
‚úÖ Progress panel shows immediately with timer
‚úÖ Status updates appear within seconds:
   - "üîÑ Starting modification process..."
   - "üöÄ Starting to modify Calculator..."
   - "üîç AI is analyzing your modification request..."
   - etc.

‚ùå OLD BEHAVIOR (FIXED):
- No UI updates for 2+ minutes
- Blank status panel
- User left wondering if anything is happening

### 4. Test MainActor Fixes

Generate an app that uses async operations:
"create a weather app that fetches data from an API"

The validator will automatically:
- Add @MainActor to ViewModels
- Fix any actor isolation issues
- Ensure UI updates are properly isolated

### Console Logs to Watch

In browser console (F12), you should see:
```
[UI] Ensuring WebSocket connection for modification: proj_xxxxx
[UI] WebSocket not connected, setting up now... (or "already connected")
[WS] Status update received: {message: "üîÑ Starting modification process...", status: "initializing"}
```

In backend terminal:
```
[NOTIFY] Sending to proj_xxxxx: type=status, status=initializing
[NOTIFY] Sent successfully to connection
```

## Quick Verification

The fix is working if:
1. Modifications show immediate UI feedback (no 2+ minute wait)
2. Progress timer starts counting immediately
3. Status messages appear in real-time
4. No "actor isolation" build errors for apps with async operations

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Ensure backend is running on port 8000
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Check backend logs for any Python errors
