# STOP. THINK. This WAS Working.

## Critical Facts
1. **Modifications USED TO WORK** - This is not a design flaw
2. **They still work initially** - Then degrade after a few uses
3. **We keep "fixing" the same issues** - Because we never found the root cause

## The Real Questions

### 1. What changed between when it worked and now?
- What code was added?
- What "fixes" were implemented?
- What new features were added?

### 2. Why does it degrade?
- Works for 2-3 modifications
- Then fails consistently
- This pattern = state/memory leak

### 3. What are we accumulating?
- Context size?
- WebSocket messages?
- File handles?
- LLM conversation history?

## Stop Adding. Start Removing.

Instead of adding more fixes:
1. **Revert to a known working state**
2. **Add logging to see what accumulates**
3. **Fix the accumulation, not the symptoms**

## The Likely Culprit

Based on the pattern (works initially, then fails):
- **Context is growing unbounded**
- Each modification adds to context
- Eventually context too large
- LLM fails or returns errors
- We see "No modifications processed"

## Tomorrow's REAL Plan

1. **DON'T add any new code**
2. **Find what's accumulating**
3. **Clear/reset it between modifications**
4. **Test 20+ modifications in a row**

## Remember

> "We've been here before. The code worked. We broke it with 'fixes'. Find what we broke."
