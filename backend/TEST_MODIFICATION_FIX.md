# Test Plan: Modification Degradation Fix

## What Was Fixed
- **Problem**: After 2-3 successful modifications, all subsequent ones fail
- **Root Cause**: Files loaded from stale in-memory state instead of fresh disk reads
- **Solution**: Always read files from disk before each modification

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd backend
python3 main.py
```

### 2. Create a Fresh Test App
- Open http://localhost:8002
- Create a simple todo app
- Wait for it to build and launch

### 3. Run Sequential Modifications
Make these modifications one after another:

1. **Change app title**: "Change the app title to 'My Awesome Tasks'"
2. **Add dark mode**: "Add a dark mode toggle in settings"
3. **Change button color**: "Change the add button color to blue"
4. **Add task counter**: "Add a counter showing total tasks"
5. **Add strikethrough**: "Make completed tasks show with strikethrough"
6. **Add clear button**: "Add a clear all button"
7. **Change font**: "Change font to SF Pro Display"
8. **Add priorities**: "Add task priority levels"
9. **Enable editing**: "Enable task editing"
10. **Add categories**: "Add task categories"

### Expected Results
âœ… **All 10 modifications should succeed**
- Each modification actually changes files
- App rebuilds with visible changes
- No "No modifications processed" errors
- Context size remains manageable

### What to Look For in Logs
Good signs:
- `[MAIN] Reading fresh files from disk for modification #X`
- `[MAIN] Cleaned context size: XXXX bytes` (should stay small)
- `[PROJECT MANAGER] Read X files from disk`

Bad signs:
- `[MAIN] WARNING: No files found on disk, falling back to memory state`
- Context size growing beyond 50KB
- Files not being modified despite "success" messages

### If Test Fails
1. Check that the fix is applied (lines mentioned in MASTER_ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md)
2. Look for any error messages in console
3. Verify files are actually changing on disk

## Success Criteria
- Can make 10+ consecutive modifications
- Each modification visibly changes the app
- No degradation in performance
- Context size stays reasonable
