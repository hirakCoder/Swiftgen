# xAI Integration Status

## Current Issue
The xAI API is returning 404 errors when trying to use the `grok-beta` model. This appears to be an API access or configuration issue.

## Error Details
```
404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions
Response: {"error":{"message":"The model `grok-beta` does not exist or you do not have access to it.","type":"invalid_request_error","code":"model_not_found"}}
```

## Implementation Status
- ✅ xAI client properly configured in `enhanced_claude_service.py`
- ✅ Using OpenAI-compatible API at `https://api.x.ai/v1`
- ✅ Model name `grok-beta` is correct according to xAI documentation
- ❌ API returns 404 error - likely API key access issue

## Next Steps
1. Verify xAI API key has proper access to the `grok-beta` model
2. Check if there are any account limitations or required permissions
3. Consider contacting xAI support if the issue persists
4. As a temporary workaround, the system falls back to Claude/GPT-4 when xAI fails

## Code Location
The xAI implementation is in `/backend/enhanced_claude_service.py` starting at line 251:
```python
xai_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=self.api_keys.get("xai", ""),
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1"
)
```
