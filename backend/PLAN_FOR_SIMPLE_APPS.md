# Plan to Ensure Simple Apps Work

## Current State
- Currency converter manually fixed and working
- SSL fix logic exists but needs verification
- Complexity detection improved

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Test ALL Simple Apps (1 hour)
Generate and test each app type:
- Calculator âœ…
- Timer âœ…
- Counter âœ…
- Todo List âœ…
- Currency Converter ðŸ”§
- Weather App ðŸ”§
- Quote App ðŸ”§

### 2. Fix Any Broken Apps (30 mins)
For each broken app:
- Identify the issue (SSL, JSON, or other)
- Apply targeted fix
- Verify in simulator

### 3. Create Automated Tests (30 mins)
- Test that generates each app type
- Verifies critical files exist
- Checks SSL config for API apps
- Runs without manual intervention

### 4. Add Safeguards (30 mins)
- Pre-generation validation
- Post-generation verification
- Automatic fixes for known issues
- Clear error messages

## Success Criteria
âœ… All 7 simple app types work in simulator
âœ… No manual fixes needed
âœ… Build time < 2 minutes for simple apps
âœ… Users see clear progress messages
âœ… Automated tests pass

## Testing Protocol
1. Clear workspace
2. Generate app with description
3. Wait for simulator launch
4. Test core functionality
5. Document any issues

## After Simple Apps Work
THEN we can focus on complex apps:
- Multi-screen navigation
- Authentication
- Database integration
- Real-time features

But FIRST, we must ensure simple apps are 100% reliable.
