# SwiftGen World-Class Restoration Plan
## Making SwiftGen Production Ready Again

### Current Status Assessment
- **Architecture**: Solid multi-LLM system with comprehensive error recovery
- **Success Rate**: Currently 0% due to environment and integration issues
- **Target**: Return to 100% success rate for simple apps, 95% for complex

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Missing Python Dependencies**: `anthropic`, `fastapi` modules not installed
2. **Integration Gaps**: Recovery systems not properly integrated with main endpoints
3. **Environment Setup**: API keys and configuration issues
4. **File Deduplication**: Duplicate files causing build failures
5. **Architect Variable Scope**: UnboundLocalError in generation flow

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Environment & Dependencies (Priority: CRITICAL)
- [ ] Install missing Python dependencies
- [ ] Verify API key configuration
- [ ] Run system recovery script
- [ ] Fix any remaining import issues

#### Phase 2: Core Functionality Restoration (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Test simple app generation (Timer, Todo, Counter, Calculator, Weather)
- [ ] Verify error recovery system integration
- [ ] Test file deduplication system
- [ ] Validate syntax checking pipeline

#### Phase 3: Modification System (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Test simple modifications (add features, UI changes)
- [ ] Test medium modifications (architectural changes)
- [ ] Test complex modifications (multi-component changes)
- [ ] Verify modification state management

#### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Apple HIG compliance verification
- [ ] iOS best practices validation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Auto-fix mechanism testing

#### Phase 5: Production Readiness (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across all complexity levels
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Error handling validation
- [ ] User experience optimization

### Success Metrics
- **Simple Apps**: 100% success rate
- **Medium Apps**: 95% success rate  
- **Complex Apps**: 90% success rate
- **Modifications**: 95% success rate across all complexity levels
- **Build Time**: <30 seconds for simple apps, <60 seconds for complex
- **Error Recovery**: 90% automatic resolution rate

### Testing Requirements
1. **App Generation Testing**:
   - Timer app with start/stop/reset functionality
   - Todo app with add/delete/complete features
   - Counter app with increment/decrement
   - Calculator app with basic operations
   - Weather app with location-based forecasts

2. **Modification Testing**:
   - Simple: Add dark mode toggle
   - Medium: Add user authentication
   - Complex: Add data persistence and sync

3. **Auto-Fix Testing**:
   - Syntax errors
   - Import issues
   - Naming conflicts
   - Build failures

### Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain working checkpoints
- **Incremental Testing**: Validate each component before integration
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Fallback Systems**: Multiple LLM options for redundancy

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Immediate (next 30 minutes)
- **Phase 2**: Within 1 hour
- **Phase 3**: Within 2 hours
- **Phase 4**: Within 3 hours
- **Phase 5**: Within 4 hours

This plan focuses on systematic restoration of functionality with comprehensive testing at each stage.
