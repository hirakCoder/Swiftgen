# Currency Converter Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate SSL Files**
   - SSL handler creates files in `Sources/Networking/`
   - File structure manager moves them to `Sources/Utils/`
   - Results in duplicates in both directories

2. **Multiple Info.plist Error**
   - Xcode build system confused by duplicate files
   - Error: "Multiple commands produce .../Info.plist"

3. **API Response Format**
   - Currency API returns `{"rates": {"EUR": 0.85}}`
   - Needs proper JSON decoding structure

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. File Structure Manager (file_structure_manager.py)
- Added duplicate prevention logic
- Skip reorganizing SSL-related files
- Track seen files to prevent duplicates

### 2. SSL Handler (robust_ssl_handler.py)
- Changed SSL file paths from `Sources/Networking/` to `Sources/Utils/`
- Consistent with file structure manager expectations

### 3. Build Service (build_service.py)
- Added duplicate file cleanup before build
- Added Info.plist error detection and fix
- Clean build folder and derived data when needed

### 4. New Utility (fix_info_plist_duplication.py)
- Removes duplicate Swift files
- Cleans build folder
- Cleans Xcode derived data

## Testing Recommendations

1. Generate a new currency converter app
2. Verify no duplicate files in project structure
3. Confirm SSL files only exist in Utils/
4. Test API calls work properly
5. Verify modifications don't create duplicates

## Expected Results

- Currency converter builds successfully
- No "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" errors
- SSL configuration works properly
- API calls fetch currency data correctly
- File structure is clean without duplicates
