# File Truncation Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that simple modification requests were failing because:

1. **File Truncation**: LLMs were only receiving the first 500 characters of each file
2. **Incomplete Context**: LLMs returned truncated files because they didn't see the full code
3. **Error Recovery Made It Worse**: The recovery system accepted truncated files as "fixed"

## Files Fixed

### 1. enhanced_claude_service.py (line 620)
**Before**: `user_prompt += f"\n--- {file['path']} ---\n{file['content'][:500]}...\n"`
**After**: `user_prompt += f"\n--- {file['path']} ---\n{file['content']}\n"`

### 2. robust_error_recovery_system.py (line 1292)
**Before**: `f"File: {f['path']}\n{f['content'][:500]}..."`
**After**: `f"File: {f['path']}\n{f['content']}"`

### 3. build_service.py (line 516)
**Before**: `missing_files_request += f"\n{file['path']}:\n{file['content'][:500]}...\n"`
**After**: `missing_files_request += f"\n{file['path']}:\n{file['content']}\n"`

### 4. robust_error_recovery_system.py (lines 1235-1265)
Added truncation detection:
- Check if recovered file is < 50% of original size
- If truncated, keep the original file instead
- Log warning when truncation is detected

## Testing Required

1. Test simple modifications like "change button color to blue"
2. Verify files aren't truncated after modification
3. Ensure error recovery doesn't trigger unnecessarily
4. Check that toolbar errors don't cause file corruption

## Additional Issues Found

1. **Escape Sequence Corruption**: `@Environment(\ .dismiss)` with space after backslash
   - This appears to be from LLM output, not our code
   
2. **Toolbar "Fix" Makes Things Worse**: Error recovery comments out toolbars instead of fixing them
   - Consider removing this "fix" or making it smarter

## Next Steps

1. Remove the warning for missing FixVerificationSystem âœ…
2. Test modifications with full file content
3. Consider adding file size validation before accepting LLM responses
4. Review if toolbar error recovery is needed at all
