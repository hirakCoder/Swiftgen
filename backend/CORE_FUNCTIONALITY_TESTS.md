# Core Functionality Tests Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the core functionality tests added to prevent regressions in critical SwiftGen features.

## Tests Added

### 1. Test Suite: `test_core_functionality.py`
Standalone test suite for critical functionality testing.

#### Tests Included:
1. **Basic App Generation** - Ensures apps build successfully
2. **Modification on Generated App** - Verifies modifications work on fresh apps
3. **Modification After Server Restart** - Tests KeyError fix for missing project_state
4. **Swift Range Operator Handling** - Verifies `"0"..."9"` not flagged as incomplete
5. **State Consistency** - Ensures modifications apply to actual files, not stale state
6. **Swift Validator Integration** - Tests semicolon removal and other fixes

### 2. Enhanced Test Suite: `test_suite.py`
Added 4 new core tests to the existing test suite:

```python
# Epic 4: Core Functionality Tests
await self.test_modification_state_consistency()
await self.test_modification_after_restart()
await self.test_swift_range_operator()
await self.test_swift_validator_integration()
```

### 3. Quick Test Runner: `run_core_tests.py`
Simple script to run core tests quickly:
```bash
python run_core_tests.py        # Run core tests only
python run_core_tests.py --full  # Run full test suite
```

### 4. CI/CD Integration: `ci_test.sh`
Bash script for continuous integration:
- Starts server automatically
- Runs all core tests
- Cleans up after testing
- Returns appropriate exit codes

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Modification Verifier - Swift Range Operator
**Problem**: Swift range operator `"0"..."9"` was incorrectly flagged as incomplete implementation.

**Fix**: Updated regex pattern in `modification_verifier.py` to exclude valid Swift syntax:
```python
# Check if it's a Swift range operator or variadic
range_pattern = r'"\w+"\.{3}"\w+"'  # "a"..."z" pattern
variadic_pattern = r'\w+\.{3}'  # String... pattern
```

### 2. Server Restart Issue
**Problem**: KeyError when modifying projects after server restart (project_state lost).

**Fix**: Added initialization check in `main.py`:
```python
if project_id not in project_state:
    project_state[project_id] = {
        "status": "active",
        "app_name": project_id,
        "version": 0,
        "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

### 3. State Consistency
**Problem**: Need to ensure modifications apply to actual disk files, not stale in-memory state.

**Test**: Added verification that:
- Files are read fresh from disk before modification
- Modified content is written back to disk
- Changes are verified by re-reading files

## Running Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Quick core tests only
python test_core_functionality.py

# Full test suite
python test_suite.py

# With server management
./run_core_tests.py
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Run before any deployment
./ci_test.sh
```

## Test Results

Current Status (as of testing):
- ✅ Swift Range Operator Handling: PASSED
- ✅ Swift Validator Integration: PASSED
- ⚠️  Basic App Generation: May timeout (increase wait time if needed)

## Important Notes

1. **Server Must Be Running**: Most tests require the server to be running on http://localhost:8000

2. **Virtual Environment**: Tests should be run within the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Test Isolation**: Each test creates its own project IDs to avoid conflicts

4. **Modification Tests**: Verify both that:
   - The modification is accepted by the API
   - The actual files on disk are changed

## Future Enhancements

1. Add performance benchmarks
2. Test SSL configuration for API apps
3. Test error recovery mechanisms
4. Add tests for all LLM models (Claude, GPT-4, xAI)
5. Test WebSocket notifications
