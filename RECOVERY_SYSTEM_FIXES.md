# SwiftGen Error Recovery System Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Recovery System Blocking**: The recovery system was using a persistent `attempt_count` that was never reset, causing it to permanently block after 3 recovery attempts across all builds.

2. **Incomplete File Collection**: The build service was only collecting Swift files from the root `Sources/` directory, missing files in subdirectories like `Sources/Models/`, `Sources/ViewModels/`, etc.

3. **File Writing Issues**: Fixed files were being written only to the root `Sources/` directory, breaking the project structure.

4. **Missing Codable Error Handling**: The recovery system didn't have specific instructions for handling Codable/Encodable/Decodable protocol conformance errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Persistent Attempt Counting
**File**: `backend/robust_error_recovery_system.py`
- Commented out the `attempt_count` increment and max attempts check
- This allows the recovery system to work on each build attempt independently
- The build service already handles attempt limiting, so this was redundant

### 2. Recursive File Collection
**File**: `backend/build_service.py`
- Changed from `os.listdir()` to `os.walk()` for collecting Swift files
- Now properly collects files from all subdirectories
- Preserves relative paths for proper file identification

### 3. Preserve Directory Structure When Writing Files
**File**: `backend/build_service.py`
- Fixed files are now written back to their original locations
- Creates directories if they don't exist
- Uses full relative paths instead of just filenames

### 4. Added Codable Error Handling
**File**: `backend/robust_error_recovery_system.py`
- Added specific instructions for Codable/Encodable/Decodable errors in the LLM prompt
- Includes example of how to add protocol conformance
- Reminds to import Foundation when needed

### 5. Fixed Escape Sequence Warning
**File**: `backend/robust_error_recovery_system.py`
- Fixed invalid escape sequence in Swift code example
- Changed `\.dismiss` to `\\.dismiss`

## Testing

A test script was created (`test_recovery_simple.py`) that verifies:
- The recovery system can be imported successfully
- The max attempts check is properly disabled
- Codable error handling instructions are present
- Build service uses recursive file collection

## Expected Results

With these fixes:
1. The error recovery system will attempt to fix errors on each build attempt
2. All Swift files in the project will be properly analyzed
3. Fixed files will maintain their directory structure
4. Codable conformance errors will be properly handled
5. The system won't get permanently blocked after a few uses

## Next Steps

To fully test the system:
1. Run the backend server with the virtual environment activated
2. Try building a project with Codable errors
3. Verify that the recovery system properly fixes the errors
4. Check that multiple recovery attempts work correctly
