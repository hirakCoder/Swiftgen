# SSL/HTTPS Support Fixed in SwiftGen

## Problem
When generating apps that use HTTPS APIs (like motivational quote apps), the system was experiencing:
- Long generation times
- SSL certificate errors in the simulator
- "An SSL error has occurred" messages
- Apps failing to fetch data from HTTPS endpoints

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Preemptive SSL Support (ssl_integration.py)
- Analyzes generated code for HTTPS usage
- Automatically adds App Transport Security (ATS) configuration
- Configures URLSession with proper SSL settings
- Adds domain exceptions for common APIs

### 2. SSL Error Recovery (build_service.py)
- Detects SSL/certificate errors during build
- Applies targeted fixes using RobustSSLHandler
- Handles various SSL error types:
  - Certificate verification failures
  - Self-signed certificates
  - TLS version mismatches
  - Hostname verification issues

### 3. Integration Points
- **main.py**: Added SSL support before project creation (Step 2.5)
- **build_service.py**: Added SSL error detection and recovery

## How It Works

### For New Apps
1. System detects HTTPS URLs or networking code
2. Automatically adds to Info.plist:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
       <dict>
           <key>api.quotable.io</key>
           <dict>
               <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
               <true/>
               <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
               <false/>
               <key>NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
               <string>TLSv1.2</string>
           </dict>
       </dict>
   </dict>
   ```

3. Configures URLSession with proper SSL handling

### For Build Errors
1. Detects SSL-related error messages
2. Applies appropriate fixes:
   - Updates Info.plist with domain exceptions
   - Adds SSL certificate handling code
   - Configures TLS settings

## Testing
To test the SSL fix, try generating apps that use HTTPS APIs:

```bash
# Motivational Quote App
"Create a motivational quote app that fetches quotes from https://api.quotable.io"

# Weather App
"Create a weather app that fetches data from https://api.openweathermap.org"

# News Reader
"Create a news reader that fetches articles from https://newsapi.org"
```

## Files Modified
- `/backend/ssl_integration.py` - New SSL integration module
- `/backend/main.py` - Added SSL support in generation pipeline
- `/backend/build_service.py` - Added SSL error detection and recovery

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - SSL support is now integrated into the generation and build pipeline
