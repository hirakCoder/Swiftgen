# SwiftGen Test Report - July 11, 2025

## Summary

Testing was initiated to verify app generation, LLM routing, and modification capabilities. The server was started successfully and initial tests were run.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ App Generation Tests

1. **SimpleTimer App**
   - Project ID: `proj_f7b3ac5a`
   - Status: Successfully generated and deployed
   - LLM Used: xAI Grok (based on logs)
   - Notes: App was launched successfully in simulator

2. **TimerPro App** 
   - Project ID: `proj_41898684`
   - Status: Generated
   - LLM Used: xAI Grok
   - Notes: More complex timer with countdown and presets

3. **TaskMaster (Todo) App**
   - Project ID: `proj_d42ba2d6`
   - Status: Generated with build errors
   - LLM Used: xAI Grok
   - Issues: Generic parameter inference error in AddItemScreen.swift
   - Recovery: Error recovery system attempted fixes

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- Basic app generation functionality is operational
- xAI Grok is being selected for UI-focused apps as expected
- Simulator deployment is working
- Error recovery system is attempting to fix build errors
- Project structure and file organization is correct

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified
1. **LLM Attribution**: "Generated by" showing as "Unknown" in API responses
2. **Build Errors**: Todo app encountered generic parameter inference issues
3. **Server Stability**: Server stopped during extended testing

### üìä LLM Routing Observations
- xAI Grok was consistently selected for UI-design focused apps
- Routing logic appears to be working correctly based on app descriptions
- Need to verify Claude and GPT-4 routing for more complex scenarios

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Fix "Generated by" display in API responses
2. Investigate and fix generic parameter inference errors
3. Test modification functionality
4. Complete testing of all app types (calculator, weather)

### Medium Priority  
1. Verify WebSocket connection for real-time updates
2. Test complex modifications (dark mode, new features)
3. Integrate SimpleModificationHandler into main endpoint

### Low Priority
1. Add complexity detection system
2. Document agent architecture

## Test Scripts Created
- `test_timer_app.py` - Simple timer app generation test
- `test_all_apps.py` - Comprehensive multi-app test suite

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix the generic parameter error pattern in error recovery
2. **Server Monitoring**: Add automatic restart capability for server crashes
3. **Testing Protocol**: Run smaller, focused tests rather than large batches
4. **Error Patterns**: Update error recovery to handle Swift generic type issues

## Status Update

Current system state:
- Server: Stopped (needs restart)
- Generated Apps: 3 (2 successful, 1 with errors)
- Todo Progress: 1/8 tasks in progress

Next session should focus on:
1. Fixing the generic parameter errors
2. Testing modifications on successfully built apps
3. Completing the app type testing suite
