# Claude Code: Initial Task

## Read These Files First
1. docs/SWIFTGEN_PROJECT_GUIDE.md - Overall project context
2. docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md - Specific tasks to implement
3. docs/CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Your coding guidelines
4. docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Quick lookup reference

## Your First Task
After reading the documentation, please:
1. Analyze the current codebase structure
2. Identify where "struct Task" naming conflicts occur
3. Implement the fix in project_manager.py as described
4. Test the fix with a simple todo app generation

## Important
- Start with Task 1 from IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md
- Follow the code style guidelines strictly
- Test after each change
- Ask if you need clarification
