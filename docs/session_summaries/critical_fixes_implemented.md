# Critical Fixes Implemented

## 1. Fixed Modification UI Not Showing Updates (2+ Minute Wait Issue)

### Problem
- Modification requests showed NO UI updates for 2+ minutes
- Backend logs showed "[NOTIFY] Sent successfully to connection" but UI remained blank
- User had to wait with no feedback while modifications were processing

### Root Causes
1. Frontend wasn't setting up WebSocket connection for modifications (only for generation)
2. WebSocket messages were sent before frontend was ready to receive them
3. Missing UI state updates (timer, progress text, button state) for modifications

### Solutions Implemented

#### Backend (main.py):
```python
# Added delay and immediate status update in _modify_app_background
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Give frontend time to set up
await notify_clients(project_id, {
    "type": "status",
    "message": "ðŸ”„ Starting modification process...",
    "status": "initializing"
})
```

#### Frontend (index.html):
```javascript
// Added WebSocket setup for modifications
if (!this.ws || this.ws.readyState !== WebSocket.OPEN) {
    console.log('[UI] WebSocket not connected, setting up now...');
    this.setupWebSocket(chatResult.project_id);
}

// Added proper UI state updates
this.isGenerating = true;
this.sendBtn.disabled = true;
this.sendBtn.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>';
this.startGenerationTimer();
```

### Result
- Modifications now show immediate UI feedback
- Real-time status updates appear within seconds
- Progress timer and status stages work properly

## 2. Enhanced MainActor Isolation Error Detection and Fixes

### Problem
- Build errors with "Call to main actor-isolated instance method from a non-isolated context"
- ViewModels updating UI without proper MainActor isolation
- Task blocks with UI updates not properly isolated

### Solutions Implemented

#### Enhanced comprehensive_code_validator.py:

1. **Added MainActor Detection**:
```python
def _check_main_actor_issues(self, file_path: str, content: str) -> List[CodeIssue]:
    # Detects:
    # - ViewModels without @MainActor
    # - Task blocks with UI updates lacking isolation
    # - Async functions updating UI without @MainActor
```

2. **Added Automatic Fixes**:
```python
def _fix_main_actor(self, content: str, issue: CodeIssue) -> str:
    # Fixes:
    # - Adds @MainActor to ViewModel classes
    # - Replaces DispatchQueue.main with MainActor.run
    # - Adds @MainActor to UI update methods
```

### Result
- MainActor issues are now detected during validation
- Automatic fixes are applied before build
- Reduces "actor isolation" build errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Modification UI Fix**:
   - Create a simple app
   - Request a modification (e.g., "add dark mode")
   - Verify immediate UI feedback and real-time updates

2. **Test MainActor Fixes**:
   - Generate an app with async operations
   - Check if ViewModels have @MainActor annotation
   - Verify no actor isolation build errors

## Summary

These critical fixes address the two most pressing issues:
1. âœ… UI now shows real-time updates for modifications (no more 2+ minute waits)
2. âœ… MainActor isolation errors are detected and fixed automatically

The system should now provide a much better user experience with immediate feedback and fewer build errors.
