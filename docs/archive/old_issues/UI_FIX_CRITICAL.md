# CRITICAL UI FIX REQUIRED

## Issues Identified

1. **UI Shows Nothing** - WebSocket messages ARE being sent but UI isn't updating
2. **Timer Keeps Running** - Timer doesn't stop after completion
3. **Slow Installation** - Installation timeout at 120s, then retries
4. **MobileCal Crash** - Calendar app crashing in simulator (not our app)

## Root Causes

### 1. UI Not Updating
- WebSocket IS connected (check browser console)
- Messages ARE being sent from backend
- UI elements might be hidden or not updating DOM

### 2. Timer Issue
- Timer stop IS called in handleGenerationComplete
- But the complete message might not reach this handler

### 3. Installation Slow
- First install attempt times out at 120s
- Falls back to temp copy method (succeeds)
- This is NORMAL for first time installs

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Debug in Browser Console
When testing, open browser console (F12) and check:
```javascript
// You should see:
[WS] Received message: {type: "status", message: "...", ...}
[WS] Status update: ...
[WS] Generation complete - stopping timer and updating UI
```

### 2. Force Show Status Panel
Add to browser console while app is generating:
```javascript
document.getElementById('statusPanel').classList.remove('hidden');
document.getElementById('detailsPanel').classList.remove('hidden');
```

### 3. Check WebSocket Connection
In browser console:
```javascript
// Check if WebSocket is connected
console.log(window.swiftGenApp?.ws?.readyState); // Should be 1 (OPEN)
```

## Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced WebSocket logging** - More console logs to track message flow
2. **Auto-show details panel** - Status details now auto-display
3. **Reduced simulator logs** - Less spam from SpringBoard checks
4. **Better error handling** - Improved project ID tracking

## What Should Happen

1. User types: "Create a simple calculator"
2. Status panel appears with stages
3. Details panel auto-opens showing real-time logs
4. Timer shows elapsed time
5. When complete:
   - Timer stops
   - Success message appears
   - Stages all turn green
   - Chat re-enables for modifications

## Testing Steps

1. Start backend: `python3 main.py`
2. Open http://localhost:8000/
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Type: "Create a simple calculator"
5. Watch console for WebSocket messages
6. If UI doesn't update, manually show panels (see above)

## Note on Simulator

The multiple "spawn" commands are NORMAL - it's checking if simulator is ready.
The MobileCal crash is unrelated - it's the Calendar app, not your generated app.
