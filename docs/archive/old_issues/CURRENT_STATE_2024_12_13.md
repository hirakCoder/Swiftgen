# SwiftGen Current State - December 13, 2024

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive debugging has been added to identify why the system hangs after error recovery succeeds. The error recovery runs successfully twice but then the process stops without sending a response to the frontend.

## Current Issue Status

### Primary Issue: System Hangs After Error Recovery
**Symptoms:**
- Error recovery runs twice and succeeds both times
- WebSocket connects successfully  
- No further progress after recovery - system appears stuck
- Frontend shows "WebSocket connected" but no build completion message

**Investigation Progress:**
1. Added extensive debugging throughout the system
2. Fixed parameter name issue in error recovery (`swift_files` instead of `files`)
3. Added logging at all critical points to trace execution flow

## Code Changes Made Today

### 1. Main.py Debugging Enhancements
```python
# Lines 547-563 - Added detailed build logging
print(f"[MAIN] Starting build for {project_id} at {project_path}")
print(f"[MAIN] Bundle ID: {bundle_id}")
print(f"[MAIN] Build service error recovery: {hasattr(build_service, 'error_recovery_system')}")

try:
    build_result = await build_service.build_project(project_path, project_id, bundle_id)
    print(f"[MAIN] Build completed with success={build_result.success}")
    print(f"[MAIN] Build errors: {len(build_result.errors) if build_result.errors else 0}")
    print(f"[MAIN] Build warnings: {len(build_result.warnings) if build_result.warnings else 0}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[MAIN] Build exception: {str(e)}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
    raise
```

### 2. Build Service Debugging
```python
# Line 262 - Track build attempts
print(f"[BUILD] Starting build attempt {attempt}/{self.max_attempts}")

# Lines 338-365 - Recovery logging
if success and fixed_files:
    print(f"[BUILD] Recovery succeeded with {len(fixed_files)} fixed files")
    # ... write files ...
    print(f"[BUILD] Recovery applied, continuing to next build attempt")
else:
    print(f"[BUILD] Recovery failed or no files returned")

# Lines 378-391 - Final failure logging
print(f"[BUILD] All {attempt} attempts exhausted. Build failed.")
print(f"[BUILD] Last errors: {last_build_errors[:3]}")
print(f"[BUILD] Returning failed result to main.py")
```

### 3. WebSocket Notification Debugging
```python
# Lines 1147-1163 - Trace all notifications
print(f"[NOTIFY] Sending to {project_id}: type={message.get('type')}, status={message.get('status')}")
if project_id in active_connections:
    await connection.send_json(message)
    print(f"[NOTIFY] Sent successfully to connection")
else:
    print(f"[NOTIFY] No active connections for {project_id}")
```

### 4. Failed Build Response Handling
```python
# Lines 629-658 - Ensure response is sent
print(f"[MAIN] Build failed, sending failure response")
print(f"[MAIN] Error count: {len(build_result.errors)}")
# ... send notification ...
print(f"[MAIN] Returning failed response: {response['status']}")
return response
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Error Recovery System
- The robust error recovery system is properly initialized
- It successfully applies fixes when errors occur
- Fixed the parameter name issue: `swift_files` instead of `files`
- Recovery writes fixed files back to disk correctly

### 2. Build Loop Issue
- Build attempts are correctly limited to 3 (max_attempts)
- Recovery is called and succeeds
- After recovery, the loop should continue to next build attempt
- **SUSPECTED ISSUE**: The loop may be exiting prematurely or getting stuck

### 3. Response Flow
- Build failure should trigger a "complete" message with status "failed"
- This should enable the UI and show error messages
- The response includes project_id, status, errors, and app_name

## Debug Output Expected

When the server runs with these changes, we should see:

```
[MAIN] Starting build for proj_abc123 at /path/to/project
[MAIN] Bundle ID: com.example.app
[MAIN] Build service error recovery: True
[BUILD] Starting build attempt 1/3
[BUILD] Build attempt 1 failed with 5 errors
[BUILD] Found 3 unique errors for recovery
[BUILD] Recovery succeeded with 2 fixed files
[BUILD] Writing fixed file: /path/to/Sources/App.swift
[BUILD] Recovery applied, continuing to next build attempt
[BUILD] Starting build attempt 2/3
...
[NOTIFY] Sending to proj_abc123: type=complete, status=failed
[MAIN] Build failed, sending failure response
[MAIN] Returning failed response: failed
```

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

1. **Run the server with debugging** to capture the exact flow when error recovery happens
2. **Check for async/await issues** - possible deadlock or unhandled promise
3. **Verify WebSocket connection** stays active during long operations
4. **Test with a simple failing app** to reproduce the issue consistently
5. **Check if recovery is being called recursively** causing stack issues

## Files Modified
- `/backend/main.py` - Added comprehensive debugging
- `/backend/build_service.py` - Added build flow debugging
- `/backend/robust_error_recovery_system.py` - Fixed parameter issue

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Start server with debugging
cd /Users/hirakbanerjee/Desktop/SwiftGen/swiftgen-mvp/backend
python3 main.py

# In another terminal, monitor logs
tail -f /Users/hirakbanerjee/Desktop/SwiftGen/swiftgen-mvp/backend/build_logs/*.log

# Test with a simple app that will fail
# Create an app with syntax errors to trigger recovery
```

## Known Working State
- Smart chat works and understands intent
- No duplicate app launches
- UI progress updates work
- Sequential modifications process one by one
- Error recovery system initializes and can apply fixes

## Current Blockers
- System hangs after error recovery succeeds
- No response sent to frontend after recovery
- User sees "WebSocket connected" indefinitely
