# Quick Fix for Current Issues

## Problem Summary
1. WebSocket connection timing issue - notifications not reaching frontend
2. Core Data entities not being generated properly (ReminderEntity)

## Root Cause
The recent changes to error recovery and modification systems didn't break these directly, but the complex app generation (with Core Data) is failing because:
- The LLM is generating Core Data setup but not the entity classes
- The WebSocket might be connecting after the backend starts sending notifications

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Revert to Simple App Generation (Fastest)
Just avoid Core Data apps for now by modifying the prompt

### Option 2: Fix Core Data Generation
Add entity generation to the error recovery system

### Option 3: Fix WebSocket Timing
Ensure WebSocket is connected before API calls

## Recommended Quick Fix
Let's add a simple check in the backend to avoid Core Data apps temporarily while we fix the real issue.
