# Codable Conformance Error Fix

## Problem
The build was failing with errors like:
- "class 'JSONDecoder' requires that 'TodoItem' conform to 'Decodable'"
- "class 'JSONEncoder' requires that 'TodoItem' conform to 'Encodable'"

The error recovery system was attempting to fix these errors 3 times but failing each time.

## Root Cause
1. The `_fix_type_errors` method in `intelligent_error_recovery.py` was just a stub returning False
2. No error pattern existed for protocol conformance errors
3. The error analysis wasn't categorizing Codable conformance errors properly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Implemented `_fix_type_errors` method
- Added logic to detect Codable/Decodable/Encodable conformance errors
- Automatically adds `: Codable` to structs/classes that need it
- Handles cases where type already has other conformances (e.g., `: Identifiable, Codable`)

### 2. Added Protocol Conformance Error Pattern
In `robust_error_recovery_system.py`:
- Added new error pattern category: "protocol_conformance"
- Added patterns to match Codable-related errors
- Added fixes guidance for protocol conformance

### 3. Updated Error Analysis
Both error recovery systems now:
- Categorize protocol conformance errors separately
- Add them to type_error category for proper handling
- Pass them to the `_fix_type_errors` method

## Result
The error recovery system can now automatically fix Codable conformance errors without requiring manual intervention or LLM-based recovery.

## Testing
To test, create an app that uses JSON encoding/decoding without adding Codable conformance - the system will automatically fix it during the build process.
